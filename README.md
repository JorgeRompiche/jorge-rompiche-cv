# Jorge Rompiche – CV

This repository contains the source files for my professional resume.

## Structure

- `cv-es.md` – Spanish version
- `cv-en.md` – English version
- Automated PDF generation via GitHub Actions

## Automation

Every push to `main` triggers a CI workflow that:

- Builds PDF from Markdown using Pandoc
- Generates both English and Spanish versions
- Uploads PDF artifacts
